   <p>Coffee is a beloved beverage known for its ability to <strong>fine-tune your focus and boost your energy levels.</strong></p>
   <p>In fact, many people depend on their daily cup of joe right when they wake up to get their day started on the right foot.</p>
   <p>In addition to its energizing effects, coffee has been linked to a long list of potential health benefits, giving you all the more reason to get brewing.</p>

      <h2>Health benefits of coffee</h2>
      <p>There are so many health benefits of coffee. This article takes an in-depth look at 5 of the top evidence-based benefits of coffee.</p>
      <div class="c-benefit">
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Boosts energy levels</strong>
             <p>
               Coffee contains <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/what-is-caffeine">caffeine,</a>
               a central nervou system stimulant that is known for its ability to fight fatigue and increase energy levels.
             </p>
             <p>
               This is because caffeine blocks the receptors of a neurotransmitter called adenosine, and this increases levels of other neurotransmitter in your brain
               that regulate your energy levels, including dopamine.
             </p>
             <p>
               One small study found that consuming caffeine increased time to exhaustion during a cycling exercise by 12% and significantly reduced subjective levels
              of fatigue in participants.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>May be linked to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes</strong>
              <p>
                Some research suggests that consuming coffee regularly could be associated with a decreased risk of developing <a href="https://www.healthline.com/type-2-diabetes">type 2 diabetes</a> over the long term.
              </p>
              <p>In fact, one review of 30 studies found that each cup of coffee people consumed per day was linked to a 6% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes.</p>
              <p>This is thought to be due to coffee's ability to preserve the function of the beta cells in your pancreas, whick are responsible for producing <a href="https://www.healthline.com/type-2-diabetes/insulin">insulin</a> to regulate blood sugar levels.</p>
              <li>
                <strong>Could support brain health</strong>
                <p>Although studies have turned up mixed results, some research suggests that coffee may help protect against certain neurodegenerative disorders, including <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-coffee-may-help-prevent-alzheimers-parkinsons">Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease</a>.</p>
                <p>
                  According to one review of 13 studies, people who regularly consumed caffeine had a significantly lower risk of developing Parkinson's disease.<br>
                  What's more, caffeine consumption also slowed the progression of Parkinson's disease over time.<br>
                  Some research suggests that drinking coffee could help protect against Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson and cognitive decline.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>May promote weight management</strong>
                <p>According to some research, coffee could alter fat storage and support gut health, both of which maybe beneficial for weight management.</p>
                <p>For example, one review of 12 studies concluded that higher coffee consumption could be associate with decreased body fat, especially in men; works for women too.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                 <strong>Linked to a lower risk of depression</strong>
                   <p>Some studies have found that drinking coffee could be associated with a lower risk of <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/depression/caffeine-and-depression">depression</a>.</p>
                   <p>According to one review of seven studies, each cup of coffee people consumed per day was linked to an 8% lower risk of depression.</p>
                   <p>
                     Another study found that drinking at least four cups of coffee
                      each day was associated with a significantly lower risk of depression,
                      compared with drinking just one cup per day.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                     What's more, one study in more than 200,000 people showed that drinking coffee was linked
                     to a lower risk of death by suicide.
